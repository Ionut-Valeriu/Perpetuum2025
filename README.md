# Phineas & Ferb Inspired Rube Goldberg Machine ü§ñüé¢

This project was developed as part of **Perpetuum**, an engineering competition organized by the Faculty of Automatic Control and Computer Science at **National University of Science and Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Description

In the spirit of the animated world of **Phineas and Ferb**, this project aimed to build a **Rube Goldberg Machine** powered by an Arduino board. Our goal was to create a complex chain reaction mechanism that captures the secret agent combining electronics, mechanics, and creativity into a playful yet technically sound invention. 

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Initialization**: The servos are set to default positions, and the sensors are primed.
2. **Start Detection**: The initial ultrasonic sensor waits for an object to be within a certain distance.
3. **Triggering Mechanism**: Once the object is detected, the first servo is activated.
4. **Chain Reaction**: The TT motor begins spinning for a short duration.
5. **Final Detection**: A second distance sensor detects when the object passes the final point.
6. **Trap Activation**: The second servo is triggered to close the mechanism.

This process simulates a real-time reaction chain, showcasing both logic control and mechanical synchronization.
